# First_Qt_Project

This is my first Qt project, designed to simply get myself familiar with the framework. It doesn't do much other than give you the option to press a button which is then disabled, only to re-enable itself shortly thereafter.

## Getting Started

The source is included, so you may compile it. Otherwise, the executable is included in `build/debug`. Do note that it is not a static build: You need the Qt dll's to run it.
